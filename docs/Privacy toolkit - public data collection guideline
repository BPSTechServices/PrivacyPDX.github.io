# **PUBLIC DATA COLLECTION GUIDELINES**


### City of Portland Privacy Toolkit

<p style="text-align: right">
Version 0.2 - public draft for comments</p>



## **PURPOSE**

This guideline provides recommendations to protect personal information collected from the public. The potential of sensitive information, should it fall into the wrong hands, to compromise the safety or security of families and their data warrants taking care when collecting and managing their data. This guide will assist by providing best practices for managing the data collected during public engagement events.


## **SCOPE**

These recommendations apply to public engagement and communication events in which data is collected about the public. Examples are sign-in sheets, written comments, demographic information and audio and video recordings.


## **FOUR STEPS TO PRIVACY**



1. Provide notice that data is being collected and may be made public.
2. Limit data collection to only what is required for the specific purpose.
3. Put records retention and deletion processes in place in case of a public records request.
4. Keep information secure and private


## **1. PROVIDE NOTICE**


    It is important to inform members of the public when their personal data is being collected and that because it will be provided to the City of Portland, it may be subject to public records requests. The purpose of the Public Records laws is to provide transparency about government operations and the information we collect about the public. This means that names, addresses, personal details and comments collected and submitted during public engagement activities must be sent to anyone who submits a formal record request to the City for this information. For details, see the State of Oregon Public Records law (ORS 192)[^1], Portland City Code chapter 3.76 on Public records[^2] and the City of Portland Privacy Policy[^3].


### RECOMMENDED ACTIONS


    City bureaus and offices conducting public engagement activities must provide notice about the collection of information and the public records act for all occasions where public information is gathered that is linked to an identifiable individual or member of the public. This means written notice language must be posted and provided in invitations to events, at meetings that are audio-recorded, or video or photos are taken, wherever sign-in sheets are collected, on portals or webpages where electronic or written comments or other means of collecting information occurs, or through email exchanges. 


    Please see Appendix A for notice language that the City of Portland uses for these purposes.


## **2. LIMIT DATA COLLECTION**


    Portland privacy principles include ‘data utility’. This principle recommends to minimize the collection of personal and other private information, while creating value to the City.


    When asking for personal information, it is important to limit the data being requested to only what is required and to tailor questions to collect the minimum amount of information about an identifiable person.


### RECOMMENDED ACTIONS


    Some examples of limiting data collection to protect privacy are:



*   When posting sign-in sheets, request only first name and last initial.
*   If demographic information must be collected, provide a separate, anonymous form or link to a survey that does not collect personally identifying information.
*   Instead of a street address, ask for the individual’s zip code or email address.
*   Use age ranges instead of requesting birthdate (1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-80, 81-older).
*   If race or ethnicity information is required, consider providing options that avoid the inclusion of countries of origin.

    For more guidelines about privacy-protecting surveys see Appendix B.



## **3. PLAN FOR RECORDS RETENTION**


    The potential for a public records request means that departments conducting public engagement activities need to maintain all records of public interactions and engagements. Please check with Archives and Records Management division of the City Auditor's office for the most recent retention schedule.


### RECOMMENDED ACTIONS



*   Locate and store all records associated with public engagements in a safe and secure location or electronic file and be prepared to provide it if requested to fulfill a records request.
*   Some public outreach activities are routine and can be destroyed at the end of their legally required retention period. Other outreach activities (major projects, unique projects) are historical and need to be retained in perpetuity. Contact Archives and Records Management for direction.


## **4. KEEP INFORMATION SECURE **


    Anyone handling personal information must accept responsibility and use good judgement for keeping it secure and private. Paperwork containing personal information should be secured and locked, and computer systems should have passwords and the latest software versions and virus protection running.


### RECOMMENDED ACTIONS


    Below are some privacy best practices to consider for securing sensitive information:


#### 
    FILES AND PAPERS



*   Install a lock on a file cabinet that currently is without one.
*   Provide a covered file box for immediate form storage needs so that paper is not left counters or on unattended desks.
*   Keep completed paperwork and documents locked up when not in use.
*   Shred paper with personal information when no longer needed. Do not throw it away or recycle it.
*   Don’t leave documents, faxes or lists with personal information on desks or counters when not in active use. Put them in a folder, lock them away in a file or box with a closed or secure lid or turn them over so they cannot be read.
*   Use good judgement on how much access to information to allow individual employees.

#### 
    WORKING SPACE

*   Install door locks that open with a combination code instead of a key. This facilitates rekeying when an employee leaves.
*   Secure an area for document storage staff by changing the file room door knob without a lock, to a door knob with a lock.
*   Post a sign that says, “Authorized Personnel Only” to limit access to a protected area.

#### 
    COMPUTERS

*   Give all computer users their own computer password. Sharing passwords is an issue for both security and accountability if someone uses the computer for non-business reasons.
*   Set up software to limit access to personal information to those who need it to do their jobs.
*   Keep computer backup copies secured or locked up.
*   Position computer screens so people passing by cannot read any personal information.
*   Set up screen savers that blank out the screen when not in use for a few minutes and require passwords to open again.
*   All emails sent or received that contain personal information must be encrypted. Encryption is available with Outlook and SharePoint is another secure method of sharing files.
*   When an employee leaves, cancel their computer password.

*   Indicate required versus optional data entry fields with an asterisk.
*   Secure the information collected via survey by not sending it over email unless it is encrypted and once collected, downloaded and stored in a secure system.
*   Do not collect IP addresses or other system information linkable to an individual (this is an option with survey services).
*   Limit use of open text fields – this limits the possibility of users mistakenly providing sensitive information like family names, health and income information or other data points).
*   Instead of open data fields, use radio buttons, multiple choice, or Yes/No options instead.
