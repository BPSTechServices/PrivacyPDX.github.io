# **DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES**


### City of Portland Privacy Toolkit
Version 0.2 - Public draft for comments

## **PURPOSE**

This guideline describes recommendations to protect personal information collected and managed through paper documents. In addition to the specific regulatory or legal requirements for managing paper documents, the nature of the information collected may be sensitive and should be handled with care. The potential of these types of records, should they fall into the wrong hands, to compromise the safety or security of Portland residents and their data warrants evaluating best practices for document creation and management.


## **SCOPE**

These recommendations apply to all forms, examples of which include program registration and participation forms, permitting applications, and event sign in sheets, and any other services that result in creation of a paper document.


## **THREE STEPS TO PRIVACY**



1. **_Put someone in charge._**
2. **_Institute methods and means to keep information secure and private._**
3. **_Set up bureau or office policy, implementation procedures and training for staff._**


### **_1. Put Someone in Charge_**

Assign responsibility to one person (Privacy Lead or Champion) whose job is to get the other steps in these recommendations completed and keep them in place. Coordinate with the bureau/office data governance team.

   a. **Privacy champions duties**
    The Privacy champions should look through the work space environment, document all paper documents and processes, list all the potential privacy issues associated with their collection and management, and address the documented issues. Following are specifics about these duties:

   *   Document collection of use of information in paper format, including storage and disposal locations.
   *   Determine steps needed to keep sensitive documents private and secure.
   *   Keep track of the steps taken to put privacy recommendations in place. For example, record the date the office installed a door lock to a file room.
   *   Create and update staff training material and other paperwork.
   *   Ensure current and new staff are trained on the policies and requirements.
   *   Enforce the privacy policy
   *   Identifying non-compliance issues.
   *   Keep records of privacy activities including who has been trained and when, who has keys or combination codes, customer complaints, requests and so on.
   *   Address any new privacy issues as they occur.

### **2. Keep Information Secure and Private**

This step is about all employees accepting responsibility and using good judgement to keep personal information secure and private and determining the appropriate steps to achieve this. There is no specific need to replace file cabinets or build new walls but instead to evaluate the environment and consider reasonable options to protect information from casual intrusion or access.



1. **Information documentation**

    One means of evaluating the privacy requirements for document management is to consider the workflow and lifecycle of the documents in question.

2. **Workflow**

    Documenting a workflow requires the office staff to write down all the steps associated with a process, including creation and use of documents with privacy concerns. This can be a bulleted list or a formal flow chart. Identifying all the steps in a process makes it easier to determine points where privacy concerns are apparent and can be addressed.

3. **Information lifecycle**

    Creating an Information Lifecycle is another means of establishing details about information that is created or collected. This allows the office to determine points at which information and documents may be better secured or handled. The following are the standard steps in the information lifecycle of a document:

    a. ***Collect/Create/Collaborate***
    Evaluate what information is collected in what forms or formats; determine if it is possible to minimize the data collected; and consider where the documents are physically collected and stored prior to use to ensure security of the documents; work with all stakeholders.

    b. ***Use/Access***
    Document how information is used to account for all the places a document travels and now the data in it is used to inform office processes.

    c. ***Share***
    Determine how data and documents are shared within and outside of the office, with special concentration on whether and how they are physically moved between locations and if they are transferred to electronic formats.

    d. ***Store***
    Evaluate short term and long-term document storage requirements, considering retention schedules and access needs.

    e. ***Dispose or De-identify***
    Identify when and how documents with personal information can and should be retained and disposed or de-identified from the subjects.

4. **Privacy best practices**

    Once the document workflow and/or lifecycle has been evaluated, there are some office privacy best practices to consider for securing sensitive information. 
    All City employees need to follow administrative rule HR 4.08 on Information Technologies. This administrative rule covers the use of City Information Technologies for internal and external communication and as a research tool and information resource. This administrative rule is accessible in this link: [https://www.portlandoregon.gov/citycode/article/12209](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/citycode/article/12209) 
    Regarding privacy best practices, consider using the privacy by design principles:
   1. Proactive not reactive; preventive not remedial
   2. Privacy as the default setting
   3. Privacy embedded into design
   4. Full functionality – positive-sum, not zero-sum
   5. End-to-end security – full lifecycle protection
   6. Visibility and transparency – keep it open
   7. Respect for user privacy – keep it user-centric

5. **Files and papers**
   *   Install locks on file cabinets used for document storage that currently are without them.
   *   Keep customer paperwork and documents locked up when not in use.
   *   Provide a covered file box for immediate form storage needs so that paper is not left on counters or on unattended desks.
   *   Shred paper with personal information when no longer needed and after the appropriate records retention period.
   *   Ensure that customer sign-in sheets are secure and only ask for required information, limiting unnecessary data if associated with a name.
   *   Note: If demographic information must be collected at sign in, provide a separate, anonymous form for that purpose.
   *   Don’t leave documents, faxes or lists with personal information on desks or counters when not in active use. Put them in folders, lock them away in a file or box with a closed or secure lid or turn them over so they cannot be read.
   *   Use judgement on how much access to information to allow individual employees. For example, a temporary receptionist or summer intern may not need access to all records but would need access to information or documents to complete work tasks.
   *   Consider whether access logs are advisable for audit, access tracking, and accountability purposes.
6. **Working space **
   *   Install door locks that open with a combination code instead of a key. This facilitates rekeying when an employee leaves.
   *   Secure an area for document storage by changing a file room door knob without a lock, to a door knob with a lock.
   *   Post a sign that says, “Authorized Personnel Only” to limit access to a protected area.
7. **Email and paper transfer**
   *   Designate a special locked or secured box for interoffice mail (sending and receiving) that contains sensitive information if it must travel to other locations.
   *   Designate one person to deliver sensitive forms and ensure they understand the procedures to secure documents in transit. This establishes accountability and limits exposure to errors.
8. **Computers**
   *   Give all computer users their own computer password. Sharing passwords is an issue for both security and accountability if someone uses the computer for non-business reasons.
   *   Set up software to limit access to personal information to those who need it to do their jobs.
   *   Keep computer backup copies secured or locked up.
   *   Position computer screens so people passing by cannot read any personal information.
   *   Set up screen savers that blank out the screen when not in use for a few minutes and require passwords to open again.
   *   All emails sent or received that contain personal information must be encrypted. Encryption is available with Outlook and SharePoint is another secure method of sharing files.
   *   When an employee leaves, cancel their computer password.

### **3. Set up Office Policy, Procedures and Training for Staff**

The Privacy champions need to train the current staff and future staff on privacy expectations. “Staff” includes part-time and full-time employees, volunteers, interns, independent contractors and anyone else who works in the office who has access to documents with personal information. New employees must be trained within a reasonable amount of time and in advance of rushed or busy times when data collection and management is especially important.

1. **Training guidelines**
   *   Written guidelines are the easiest and best way to train people. So, the first step is to tailor the privacy practices to the specific environment and develop staff training:
   *   Determine how to meet the privacy recommendations to secure and manage sensitive information for the specific locations in question.
   *   Create a checklist of all privacy and security requirements for each step of the forms creation and management process.
   *   Attach this material as part of the office policy. Require all staff to read this guideline and its attachments as part of training processes.
   *   Hold a staff meeting to go over the written material.
   *   During the training sessions, go over all forms and how they must be kept private and secure.
   *   Have everyone sign a form stating they understand the material and will enforce the office policy.
   *   Ensure everyone understands the new procedures and has no confusion or unanswered questions.

### **4. Electronic Documents**

Electronic documents are more secure and offer better alternatives for document management. Such systems can reduce the need to manage secure mail and carrier processes outlined above; would further improve information sharing between locations; reduce archival costs; and provide better data retention compliance. Unless using a specialized software like AMANDA or SAP, city offices should use TRIM, the City's existing ERMS/EDMS, to manage their electronic records.

A full list of system benefits is below:



1. **General definition**

    An electronic document management system (EDMS) is a software program that manages the creation, storage and control of documents electronically. The primary function of an EDMS is to manage electronic information within an organization’s workflow.

2. **System benefits**
   *   Increased Security & Control: Achieving adequate controls through a manual paper or filing system is extremely challenging. Electronic document management can greatly increase security and control over information access. This includes being able to set permissions for each document, folder or cabinet and clearly identifying who can access and download documents.
   *   More Reliable Backups: Paper documents are difficult to backup. Once data has been digitized, backup copies may be created to store off-site. This also ensures that data is available in case of emergency or disaster situations.
   *   Improved Data Retention Compliance: Centrally managed electronic documents may be stored and deleted according to predetermined retention schedules. Automatic deletion dates and processes may be created to ensure compliance with legal retention and deletion requirements.
   *   Facilitated Data Sharing: The ability to create and implement information workflows greatly improves internal and external data sharing. For example, an employee or manager may be able to identify where a file is in the approval process at any given time and share medical forms for outside class attendees with class leaders.
   *   Lower Archiving Costs: Processing, storing and retrieving archived records can be significantly improved and costs reduced when moving from paper to electronic environments.
   *   Improved Version Control: Being able to search for a specific document or file - quickly - allows users to identify which record is the most current version. Also, seeing the time and date stamp of when that document was last updated provides great benefits to users wanting to reference the most recent record.
   *   Increased Efficiency & File Management: The document management process also offers significant productivity improvements over searching for information in paper filing cabinets, including decreased opportunities for misfiling or losing documents. Once located online, a document may be printed, shared or read on-screen.
   *   Better Searching Capabilities: Finding data from indexed content reduces the amount of time searching for information. Most document management software uses Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, which is a technology that enables you to convert different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDF files or images captured by a digital camera into editable and searchable data. Once data has been converted using OCR software, it is much easier to organize, search, store and display online.
   *   More Consistent Content: ERMS better ensures that content is consistently formatted, named and controlled. Implementing digital workflows or designing how documents are filed, typically generates content that is consistently saved and archived the same way.
