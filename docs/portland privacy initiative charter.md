# **PORTLAND PRIVACY INITIATIVE CHARTER**
Version 0.2 Public draft for comments

## **Introduction**

The City collects and exchanges data from the public in the course of conducting everyday business processes.  The Portland Privacy Initiative will provide policy, operational support, training and guidance concerning privacy impacts associated with data collection, data sharing, data retention, surveillance technologies, smart city technologies, mobile computing, social media and internet-based interactions that are conducted in the course of doing City business. 

Specific responsibilities include the creation and administration of policy, compliance metrics, education, maintenance and support for privacy related compliance across the City of Portland. The initiative will operate with the executive sponsorship of the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability and in response to Portland Privacy and Information Protection City Council resolution 37437. 

This document is scheduled to be revised annually. 


## **Mission**
**To build robust public trust about the use and management of personal and sensitive information by the City of Portland through the application of the Portland Privacy Principles and other privacy best practices.**


## **Vision**
**The constitution of privacy initiative services will channel resources to creating, documenting, communicating, and assigning accountability for the City of Portland privacy policies and procedures. This includes defining a governance and operational structure to ensure appropriate accountability, effective public participation and supportive infrastructure in place to develop, comply with and maintain privacy policies through City equity values and goals.**


## **Values**

To build public trust the City of Portland privacy initiative efforts will be guided by the City’s Privacy and Information Protection Principles and the following values:

**Context and evidence driven** - Information is more valuable when contextualized, data and information value depends on who gets benefited and impacted by it. 

**Data as Public asset** - We recognize data as publicly-owned resource/asset and support data use and sharing to fulfill through all. 

**Transparency and accountability** - How the city uses and collects data is understandable and accessible and who owns and has access to that information. 

**Equity** - We believe that the impacted communities, particularly those vulnerable and historically marginalized, must be part of the process when designing programs, services, and policies related to the collection and use of data. 

**Ethics** - We believe that the City of Portland has an ethical responsibility to provide good stewardship, accuracy and quality of data, resources and a responsibility to understand impacts and due diligence of unintended consequences.

**Legal requirements** - City of Portland is responsible for managing public data according to all applicable commitments and legal requirements. 


## **Organization**

Other elements of the IT governance structure will support and be influenced by the Privacy initiative:
